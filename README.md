# Question_Answering_system-using-pdf
This is a simple Question Answering System made using BERT(Bi-Directional Encoder Representations from Transformer). In this project we made an interface using Tkinter library where we can browse our pdf file and can give the question in the dialog box. After submitting our question, the answer will be shown in the answers dialog box.
